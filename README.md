# Wrangle and Analyze Data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, the goal of this project is to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. The data wrangling efforts are to be documented in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analysis and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset to be wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "[they're good dogs Brent](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
